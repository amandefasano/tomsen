# Tomsen
Project n°11 of the OpenClassrooms software testing's diploma course

## Description
PayForge is a fictive company, specialised in finance. As a QA consultant, I was in charge of conceiving a test strategy for the first version of their project Tomsen, a banking consultation application.\
My responsibilities were to analyse and refine the product requirements.\
Then, I had to build the test strategy by defining relevant test scenarios, choosing appropriate test methods, determining the resources necessary to the execution of the test campaign, planing the strategy key steps, and giving recommandations.\
Eventually, I wrote a test specification document containing test cases that cover all the application functionalities.
